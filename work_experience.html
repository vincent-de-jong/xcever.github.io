								<p>The PhD project revolves around the use of visible-light photocrosslinkers (Ruthenium and Sodium Persulfate) in the use of stabilizing patient-derived Lipoaspirates used in reconstructive surgical procedures. <br> 
								The research focuses on standardizing procedures that enable more predictable crosslinking results, aiming to compensate for large patient to patient variablity. </p>
								<p> During the PhD, Vincent has worked closely with plastic reconstructive surgeons to ensure that the developments in the lab remain transferable into the clinic.</p>

									<h3>Developing the Lab-scale production plant for In-air microparticle fabrication</h3>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								
								<p> I rejoined IamFluidics after my original plans to travel were scraped during Lockdown. Before I left, I had transferred my knowledge to a collegue and was now taking on a new role in the company, developing the first lab-scale production facility for IamFluidics. <br>
									My responsibilities ranged over several different sections. <br>
									The facility needed to comply with cGMP, which meant that all the equipment we developed, as well as logistical work-flows, storage and quality control processes needed to be designed in compliance. I was responsible for matching these requirements to the allocated space. <br>
									Additionally, I was still consulting on the pilot-scale fabrication machine and leading the development of the CIP machine that would be used for all required equipment. (with the help of an external consulting firm). </p>
									<p>
									In July of that year we began training my replacement, transfering knowledge and skills, before leaving at the end of August to pursue a postgraduate degree in Bioengineering at the University of Oregon, USA. </p>
									<p> During this time, I learned a lot about developing processes, and spent a lot of time in meetings with external parties, further learning how to manage and lead my own projects. </p>

								<p>Continuing the development of the in-air microfluidics technology from my first master thesis into a benchtop production system. I made multiple iterations at improving the mechanics and understanding of the technology, building several devices to upscale the technology to produce microparticles (see patent WO2021260668A1). <br> Additionally, I laid the ground-work producing macro-
								particles (1000Î¼m - 3mm) and parallelization. <br> 
								In later stages we collaborated with professional machine building companies where I was one of the main technical consultants, providing input re-
								quirements for components and part designs in liquid control, as well as
								mechanical-, electrical-, and vision-systems.</p>
								<p>
								Since I was the first full time employee at IamFluidics, I had the opportunity for several unique experiences. Firstly, I was able to design and set up a laboratory together with my boss, Tom Kamperman. From budgeting, to finding solutions to match or unqiue requirements for the in-air microfluidics process, many of the systems are still in place today. Additionally, I had the privilege to train and supervise several of the new employees, as well as a bachelor student, doing her thesis project with us. </p>
